## ðŸŽˆ What is this?

Manim Notebook is a VSCode extension tailored to your needs when writing Python code to animate mathematical concepts with 3Blue1Brown's [Manim library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). It's *NOT* a Jupyter Notebook; instead it enriches your existing Python files with interactive Manim cells that let you live-preview parts of the code and instantly see the animations.

Originally, the motivation for this extension was Grant Sanderson's video [How I animate 3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI?feature=shared) where he shows his Manim workflow in Sublime Text. This extension brings a similar workflow to VSCode but even goes further and provides a rich VSCode integration.

## ðŸ’» Usage

Our VSCode **walkthrough** will guide you through the first steps and provide a sample file. The walkthrough should open automatically upon installation of [the Manim Notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Manim-Notebook.manim-notebook). If not, you can invoke it manually: open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`) and search for `Manim Notebook: Open Walkthrough`.

The main concept is that of a Manim Cell, which is just a regular Python comment, but one that starts with `##` instead of `#`.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Manim Cells**. Split your code into Manim Cells that start with `##`. You will be presented with a CodeLens to preview the animation (and you can even _reload_ your changed Python files such that you don't have to restart the preview).
- **Preview any code**. Simple as that, select any code and preview it. No manual copy-pasting needed.
- **With or without Terminal**. The extension parses the `manimgl` terminal output to provide rich VSCode integrations and makes possible an almost terminal-free workflow.
  - Shows the progress of the live Manim preview as VSCode progress bar.
  - Takes a user-defined delay into account, e.g. to wait for custom shell startup scripts (like `venv` activation).
  - State management: keeps track of the ManimGL state to react accordingly in different situations, e.g. prevent from running multiple statements at the same time.
- **Video export**. Export your animations to a video file. A small wizard will guide you through the most important settings.
- **And more...** Find all commands in the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`) by searching for `> Manim Notebook`. E.g. another command lets you `clear()` the window. Yet with another one you can start the scene at your cursor.

<sub>
In the long run, we aim to even provide a <strong>Debugger for Manim code</strong> such that you can step through your animations and run until breakpoints. This would be a huge step forward in the Manim development workflow. For now, the Manim Cells that we provide are a start towards a more interactive experience.
