> [!warning]
> This VSCode extension is specifically for [3b1b's original manim library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) and *NOT* the [Manim Community Edition (Manim CE)](https://www.manim.community/).


## ðŸŽˆ What is this?

Manim Notebook is a VSCode extension that tailors your needs when writing Python code to animate mathematical concepts with 3Blue1Brown's [Manim library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). It's *NOT* a Jupyter Notebook; instead it enriches your existing Python files with interactive Manim cells that let you live-preview parts of the code and instantly see the animations.

Originally, the motivation for this extension was Grant Sanderson's video [How I animate 3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI?feature=shared) where he shows his Manim workflow in Sublime Text. This extension brings a similar workflow to VSCode but even goes further and provides a rich VSCode integration.


## ðŸ’» Usage

Our VSCode **walkthrough** will guide you through the first steps. It should open automatically upon installation of [the Manim Notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bhoov.vscode-manim). If not, you can invoke it manually: open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`) and search for `Manim Notebook: Open Walkthrough`.

The main concept is that of a Manim Cell, which is just a regular Python comment, but one that starts with `##` instead of `#`.
