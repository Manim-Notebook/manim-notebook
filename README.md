# Manim Notebook

VSCode extension for replicating Grant Sanderson's `manim` workflow for Sublime Text from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbu7Zu5X1zI)

**Note** this extension is specifically for [3b1b's original manim library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), NOT the community version.

## Example usage

1. [Install manimgl](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/installation.html), make sure that the command `manimgl` works in your terminal
2. Open your manim file (e.g. `scene.py`) in VSCode
3. Place your cursor where you want to start the scene, on a line of code within the `construct` method in a scene class
4. Run the VSCode command: `cmd+shift+p` -> `Manim Notebook: Start scene at cursor`  
    (This command runs `manimgl scene.py NAME_OF_SCENE -se <lineNumber>` in your terminal)  
    In the upper-right of your screen - the manim interactive video will appear.

<br />

Then you can do either:

- Write some comments which start with: `##`.  
    The clickable "Preview Manim Cell" buttons will appear above each such comment.  
    Clicking on one will run it.  
    It is equivalent to: `cmd+shift+p` -> `Manim Notebook: Preview active Manim Cell`

- Place your cursor on some line (or highlight several lines),  
    `cmd+shift+p` -> `Manim Notebook: Preview selected Manim code`  
    This will run the selected lines.

## Keybord shortcuts

You can use the default keyboard shortcuts for these commands, or assign your own.  

- the default shortcuts all start with `cmd+'`
- use `cmd` or `ctrl` depending on your OS

All current commands are:

- `Manim Notebook: Start scene at cursor`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+s`
- `Manim Notebook: Preview active Manim Cell`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+e`
- `Manim Notebook: Preview selected Manim code`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+r`
- `Manim Notebook: Remove all objects from scene`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+c`
- `Manim Notebook: Quit preview`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+w`
