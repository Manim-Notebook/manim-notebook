# Manim Notebook

VSCode extension for replicating Grant Sanderson's `manim` workflow for Sublime Text from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbu7Zu5X1zI)

**Note** this extension is specifically for [3b1b's original manim library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), NOT the community version.


## Example usage

1. [Install manimgl](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/installation.html), make sure that the command `manimgl` works in your terminal
2. Open your manim file (e.g. `scene.py`) in VSCode
3. Place your cursor where you want to start the scene, on a line of code within the `construct` method in a scene class
4. Run the VSCode command: `cmd+shift+p` -> `Manim Notebook: Start scene at cursor`  
    (This command runs `manimgl scene.py NAME_OF_SCENE -se <lineNumber>` in your terminal)  
    In the upper-right of your screen - the manim interactive video will appear.

Then you can do either:

- Write some comments which start with: `##`.  
    The clickable "Preview Manim Cell" buttons will appear above each such comment.  
    Clicking on one will run it.  
    It is equivalent to: `cmd+shift+p` -> `Manim Notebook: Preview active Manim Cell`

- Place your cursor on some line (or highlight several lines),  
    `cmd+shift+p` -> `Manim Notebook: Preview selected Manim code`  
    This will run the selected lines.


## Keybord shortcuts

You can use the default keyboard shortcuts for these commands, or assign your own.  

- the default shortcuts all start with `cmd+'`
- use `cmd` or `ctrl` depending on your OS

All current commands are:

- `Manim Notebook: Start scene at cursor`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+s`
- `Manim Notebook: Preview active Manim Cell`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+e`
- `Manim Notebook: Preview selected Manim code`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+r`
- `Manim Notebook: Remove all objects from scene`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+c`
- `Manim Notebook: Quit preview`.  
    Shortcut: `cmd+' cmd+w`


## Demonstration

The resulting workflow can look like Grant's ðŸ¥³

## Customization

- There are some settings that you can tweak, just press `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` in order to open the settings and search for `Manim Notebook`.
- Customize the color of the Manim Cells in your `settings.json` file as [described here in the VSCode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_customize-a-color-theme). Why not go for a more red-ish color of Manim Cells? ðŸŽ¨

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an issue, search for some related keywords first in the [issues](https://github.com/bhoov/manim-notebook/issues). If you can't find anything, feel free to open a new issue. To analyze the problem, we need a **log file** from you:

- Open the command palette `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P`)<br>and use the command `Manim Notebook: Record Log File`.
- Then set the log level by searching for `Manim Notebook` and selecting `Trace`.
- Now reproduce the issue, e.g. by running a command that causes the problem or previewing a certain Manim cell etc.
- Once you're done, click on the button in the status bar (bottom right) to finish recording. The log file will be opened afterwards.
- Drag-and-drop the log file into the GitHub issue text field (as a _file_, i.e. please don't copy-paste its _content_ because this would make it hard to read).
