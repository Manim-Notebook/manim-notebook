# vscode-manim 

Very simple VSCode extension for replicating Grant Sanderson's `manim` workflow for Sublime Text from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbu7Zu5X1zI)

**Note** this extension is specifically for [3b1b's original manim library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), NOT the community version.

## Example usage

After installing:

1. Open your manim `scene.py` in VSCode (replace `scene.py` with your manim file)
2. In the attached terminal, run `manimgl scene.py NAME_OF_SCENE -se 155` (replace 155 with line number to start debugging). In the upper-right of your screen the manim interactive video should pop up
3. Highlight the "section" you want to run (In manim, a section is a comment (`id`) followed by a block of code )
4. Type `cmd+shift+p` "Checkpoint paste from vscode-manim" ( or default binding `cmd+' cmd+r` ). This will copy the selected code to the clipboard and send the `checkpoint_paste()` command from manim into the interactive window.

The resulting workflow looks like Grant's ðŸ¥³

**Default keyboard bindings**:
- `cmd+' cmd+r` :: Run the `checkpoint_paste()` command from 3b1b's manim library on the highlighted code lines (`manim-notebook.previewSelection`)
- `cmd+' cmd+e` :: Execute all lines of the active manim cell interactively (`manim-notebook.previewManimCell`)

## Local Development

Prerequisite: install `vsce` (`npm i -g vsce`)

**Install locally**

After making changes:

1. Bump the version in `package.json`
2. `vsce package` (select `y`; a `.vsix` file will be created) 
3. `cmd+shift+p` > "Extensions: Install from VSIX" > select the `.vsix` file
4. reload window

[Alternative](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension):

- open `src/extension.ts`
- to run the extension in a new window: `F5`  
    (or: `cmd+shift+d` -> `Run Extension`)  
    (or: `cmd+shift+p` -> `Debug: Start Debugging`)
- after extension code changes: in that opened window: `cmd+shift+p` -> `Reload Window`

To publish, bump the version in `package.json` and
