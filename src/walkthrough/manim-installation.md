# Manim Installation

> **Manim Notebook only works with ManimGL by 3Blue1Brown, NOT with the community edition of Manim (Manim CE)**.

If you haven't already installed ManimGL, follow the [**Manim installation guide**](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/installation.html). This will be the most difficult part of all the steps here and there are quite a few dependencies to install. But don't despair; with a bit of patience and StackOverflow you will get there.

We recommend to install Manim by cloning the GitHub repo and using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3b1b/manim.git
cd manim
pip install -e .
```

This way, you can easily update Manim by pulling the latest commits from the repo (`git pull`) and don't have to wait for a new release.

Check your Manim version by running `manimgl --version` or just click on the button on the left.
