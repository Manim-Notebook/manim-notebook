 * still running. Instead, it only captures whether reading/writing to clipboard
 * is currently happening to prevent unpredictable behavior.
 * 
 * We don't need to capture the state of `checkpoint_paste()` because users
 * might actually want to preview a cell (or another one) again from the start
 * even though the animation is still running. With the new VSCode terminal
 * shell integration, it will automatically send a `Ctrl + C` to the terminal
 * when a new command is sent, so the previous command will be interrupted.
