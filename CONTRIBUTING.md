## Style Guidelines

Right now, the goal is to replicate Grant's sublime workflow in VSCode. Thus, we currently aim to keep things minimal and focused.

- Most new functionality should be added to `src/extensions.ts`
- Use clear and descriptive variable/function names.
- As much as possible, minimize editing global state (e.g., the clipboard). This is already done a lot inside the manim ðŸ™ˆ

## Additional Guidelines

- Before starting work on a new feature, please open an issue to introduce it and allow discussion
- There is currently no documentation. Keep your code clean and describe the functionality in the github issue as much as possible.
