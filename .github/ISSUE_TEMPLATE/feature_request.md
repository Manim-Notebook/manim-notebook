<!-- Hi there 👋  -->
<!-- ❗ Manim Notebook is only for 3Blue1Brown's Manim version and NOT for the Manim Community (Manim CE) edition. -->
<!-- ❗ Please delete the pre-filled sentences in this issue template once you have worked through the respective point.  -->

## 🎈 Motivation

Thanks for proposing a new feature to Manim Notebook. Before describing the feature, we need to know *what problem* it solves in the first place. Don't shy away from giving context and background information. What is the current state that you don't like and why? Maybe even include some code snippets or a screen recording.

## 💠 Feature

Now, how could a new feature solve this? How would it look like? Be as precise as possible. Maybe even include some UI mockup?

## ♻ Workaround

Maybe you found an alternative way to solve your problem in the meantime. Describe it here such that other users can profit from it until we might implement your desired feature.

<!-- Last but not least, note that we are a small team spread over the world developing this extension in our free time. We're not paid for this. Be merciful, we do our best, but we can for sure not promise that we will turn your feature request into reality at any point in time and might not be the quickest to respond. -->
